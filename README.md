//Description about project
This project is a Django-based News Website that dynamically fetches and displays news articles categorized into sections like Sports, Politics, Entertainment, and Share Market. 
The website allows administrators to add, edit, and manage news articles through the Django admin panel. 
Users can view category-specific news on dedicated pages, with a clean and responsive design powered by Bootstrap. 
The project integrates with external APIs to fetch real-time news.
